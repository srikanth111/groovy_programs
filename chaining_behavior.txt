Chaining behaviour in groovy:

Groovy Programming language supports stackable traits.
Stackable defines as the certain files are arranged or stored in orderly. It can also called as collecting files in orderly.

chaining behaviour allows to delegate the methods from one trair to another trait if current trait is not working to handle the messages.
